# DiscordAlwaysWrite
this utilizes discord API to send "writing" to any channel

this kinda breaks discord TOS so use at your own risk.

# Requirements
- .NET 8 (or later) runtime installed on your system.

# How to Use
1. Download the 'App' folder.
2. Run 'DAPI.exe'.
3. Enter your Discord token when prompted.
4. Enter the Channel ID where you want the constant typing.
5. If the console displays "writing...", it indicates the application is functioning.
