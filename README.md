# DiscordAlwaysWrite
this utilizes discord API to send "writing" to any channel

this kinda breaks discord TOS so use at your own risk.

# how to use?
download the App folder
run DAPI.exe
insert your discord key
insert channelID in which you want to be constantly typing in
if console says "writing..." it means it should work
